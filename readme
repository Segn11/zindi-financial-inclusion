Africa Bank Account Prediction

Predicting financial inclusion in Africa using machine learning. This project aims to identify individuals most likely to have a bank account across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.

🚀 Project Overview

Financial inclusion remains a key challenge in Africa. Despite the growth of mobile money and fintech solutions, access to traditional bank accounts is still a critical factor for economic development.

This project builds a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account, helping inform strategies for improving financial access.
